/* Algorithm:
 * 		To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of backtracking.

		According to the backtracking algorithm:
		
		1) Fix a character in the first position and swap the rest of the character with the first character. 
         Like in ABC, in the first iteration three strings are formed: ABC, BAC, and CBA by swapping A with A, B and C respectively.
		   
		2) Repeat step 1 for the rest of the characters like fixing second character B and so on.
		
		3) Now swap again to go back to the previous position. E.g., from ABC, we formed ABC by 
        fixing B again, and we backtrack to the previous position and swap B with C. So, now we got ABC and ACB.
		   
		4) Repeat these steps for BAC and CBA, to get all the permutations.
		
 * Algorithm Paradigm: Backtracking 
 * Time Complexity:O(n*n!) Note that there are n! permutations and it requires O(n) time to print a permutation.
 * Auxiliary Space: O(r â€“ l).
